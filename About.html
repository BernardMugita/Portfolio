                <p>I was born on a Wednesday evening, grew up at our Ngong home. To parents, Charles Mugita and Teresia Gati.
                Brother to PaulAnne Matinde, Judith Nyaboke and Francis Flynn.  </p>

                <p></p>
                
                <p>I am a twenty year old guy aspiring to be someone in the future. My path has now got me at Moringa school 
                    where i look to become a better software developer at the end of my journey. The name Moringa school was 
                    mentioned first by a friend who went there then by an ispired dad and thats how i found mmy way into Moringa.
                </p>
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p>My first week at Moringa has been worth-while honestly. Meeting new people, learning new things has just been
                    beneficial the last week first week i was there. It makes me anxious to start the second week. I also hope 
                    everything i am gonna learn will impact my career perfectly.
